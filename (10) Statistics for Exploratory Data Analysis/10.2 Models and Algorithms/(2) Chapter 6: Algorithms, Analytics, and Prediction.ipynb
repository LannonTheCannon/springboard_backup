The chapter introduces supervised and unsupervised learning, which are two of the main types of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is used when the response variable is known, and the goal is to build a model that can predict the response variable based on the values of the predictor variables. The chapter explains how to build a binary classification tree, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for binary classification problems. The chapter also covers model evaluation through error matrices, which are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is used when the response variable is unknown, and the goal is to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The chapter discusses clustering algorithms, which are a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar data points together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter also covers the concept of feature engineering, which is the process of selecting and transforming the predictor variables to improve the performance of the predictive model. The chapter emphasizes the importance of selecting the right features and avoiding overfitting, which occurs when the model is too complex and fits the noise in the data, rather than the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter concludes with a discussion of more complex techniques like random forests and neural networks, which are used for more complex prediction problems. The chapter discusses the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability, and highlights the importance of model evaluation using metrics like mean-squared error and Brier scores.\n",

    "\n",
    "This chapter gives us the lay of the land when it comes to using algorithms to do statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning = using an algorithm to make predictions when you know in advance what you’re looking for. To do it properly, we need to strictly train the algorithm on a subset of the data (the training set, and test it on another (the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning = using an algorithm to find patterns in data, when you don’t know in advance what you’re looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, dimensionality reduction (or reduction in the number of columns) is a necessary prerequisite to using a classification algorithm; this is known as feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary classification tree asks a sequence of yes/no questions, examining features in sequence until a classification is made. Such trees are evaluated with error matrices which represent accuracy (% correctly classified) sensitivity (% of those with the feature of interest correctly classified) and specificity (% of those without that feature correctly classified) done on both the training and test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms that output a probability (or a number) rather than a simple yes/no binary classification are often compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic (or ROC) curves , which pick a threshold value above which a data-point is classified as a ‘yes’ and below which as a ‘no’. Different choices of value here change the sensitivity and specificity values of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm also needs calibration: a check that the observed frequencies of events match those expected by the probabilistic predictions of the outcome. E.g: if some event is given the probability of 0.85, we need to check that that event actually occurs roughly 85% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean-squared error measures the performance of our algorithm, and is the average of the squares of the errors; the average mean-squared error is known as the Brier score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excessively adapting a classification tree to the training data makes its predictive power decline, and is known as over-fitting. We overfit when we take into account all the available information (reducing bias) but thereby increasing variation in our estimates. Since too much bias is bad, we need to make a judgment on the bias/variance trade-off. We can use repetitions of cross-validation (removing a percentage of the training data, developing the algorithm on the remaining data, and then testing it on the removed data) to help counter this. We typically build a classification tree by deliberately overfitting, and then pruning the tree back to something simpler and more robust."

    "1. What is supervised Learning?\n",
    ">  Supervised learning involves the construction of classification algorithms based on cases with confirmed membership of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be compared to a teacher teaching a student. Just as a teacher provides guidance to a student to learn a new concept, a supervised learning algorithm learns from a set of labeled examples provided by a human expert. The labeled examples consist of input data (the features) and corresponding output data (the labels). The algorithm then learns to associate the input data with the correct output data, similar to how a student learns to associate a new concept with the correct answer provided by the teacher. Once the algorithm has learned from the labeled examples, it can be used to predict the output data for new input data. Just as a student can use their knowledge to answer new questions on a test, the algorithm can use its learned knowledge to make predictions on new data."

    "> Unsupervised learning involves the construction of algorithms that spot patterns in data when we don't know in advance what we're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be compared to a group of people trying to identify patterns in a complex puzzle without any prior knowledge about it. Each person in the group is given a piece of the puzzle and is asked to find other pieces that fit with it. Over time, the group discovers that some pieces are similar to each other and can be grouped together. Through this process of trial and error, the group gradually identifies clusters of similar pieces and begins to piece together the larger puzzle. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm similarly learns from a set of unlabeled examples without any guidance. The algorithm identifies patterns and relationships in the data and groups similar data points together. Over time, the algorithm gradually uncovers the underlying structure of the data and identifies clusters of similar data points. This process is similar to how a group of people gradually identify patterns in a complex puzzle through trial and error."

    "3. It can be good practice to do feature engineering with, for example, a clustering algorithm prior to using those fields in a classification algorithm.\n",
    ">True\n",
    "\n",
    "Using unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering algorithms, for feature engineering can help to identify patterns and relationships in the data and create new features that can improve the performance of a classification algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a chef trying to create a new recipe for a dish, but you have limited ingredients to work with. To create a delicious dish, you might try to group similar ingredients together based on their flavor profiles and create new combinations of ingredients from these groups. For example, you might group spicy ingredients together and create a new combination of spices that works well together. This process of grouping and combining similar ingredients is similar to using a clustering algorithm for feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of feature engineering, you have a dataset with several features, but some of these features may be highly correlated with each other or not informative for the classification algorithm. By using a clustering algorithm, you can group similar features together and create new features based on the group assignments. These new features may be less correlated with each other and more informative for the classification algorithm, similar to how grouping and combining similar ingredients can create a new and delicious dish."

    "4. For any problem that can be solves to some degree of accuracy with a basic classification model, there is some neural network we could construct that could solve it with a higher degree of accuracy.\n",
    "> False\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, using a neural network for a problem that can be solved with a basic classification model may lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and fits the noise in the data, rather than the underlying signal. Additionally, neural networks can be more difficult to interpret than basic classification models, which can be a disadvantage in some applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it's not always the case that a neural network can solve a problem with higher accuracy than a basic classification model. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem, the size and quality of the data, the computational resources available, and other factors.\n",

    "For this particular task, walking or biking may be sufficient and even faster than driving or taking a plane, which may be overkill and not efficient. Similarly, for a problem that can be solved with a basic classification model, such as logistic regression or decision trees, using a more complex neural network may be overkill and not necessary. In fact, using a neural network may lead to overfitting and worse performance than the simpler models. Therefore, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem and its complexity, and more complex models may not always lead to better performance.\n"

    "> % correctly classified\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a classification tree that tries to predict a success rate for a job interview, accuracy refers to the proportion of correctly classified cases (i.e., the number of successful interviews correctly predicted as successful and the number of unsuccessful interviews correctly predicted as unsuccessful) out of the total number of cases.\n",

The accuracy of the classification tree would be (75+15)/100 = 0.9 or 90%.\n",

    "Accuracy is a common evaluation metric for classification models because it provides a simple and intuitive measure of overall model performance. It is calculated by dividing the number of correctly classified cases by the total number of cases.

    "> When it is over-adapted to the training data so that its predictive ability starts to decline\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a common problem in statistical modeling that occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying signal. Overfitting can lead to a model that performs well on the training data but has poor generalization performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a statistical model is over-adapted to the training data, meaning that the model has too many parameters relative to the size of the training data. In this scenario, the model can fit the random noise in the training data, which can lead to overly complex models that have poor predictive performance on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are trying to fit a linear regression model to a dataset with ten predictor variables, but we only have 20 observations. The model may be able to fit the training data well, but the model may be too complex and overfit the noise in the data. In this case, the model may have poor generalization performance and may not be able to make accurate predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting, it is important to use techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and feature selection to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization performance.

    "> Overfitting leads to less bias but at a cost of more uncertainty or variation in the estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in statistical modeling that describes the relationship between the model's bias and variance and its predictive performance. The bias of a model refers to the difference between the expected value of the model's predictions and the true value, while the variance of a model refers to the variability of the model's predictions for different training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff arises because reducing one source of error (bias or variance) can increase the other. For example, if we increase the complexity of a model, we may be able to reduce its bias, but this can lead to an increase in variance and overfitting. On the other hand, if we reduce the complexity of a model, we may be able to reduce its variance and overfitting, but this can lead to an increase in bias and underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is similar to finding the right balance of ingredients in the sauce. If you add too many ingredients, or too much of any one ingredient, the sauce may become too complex and unappetizing. Similarly, if you make a model that is too complex, or has too many features, it may overfit the data and perform poorly on new data. On the other hand, if you use too few ingredients, or not enough of any one ingredient, the sauce may be bland and uninteresting. Similarly, if you make a model that is too simple, or does not have enough features, it may underfit the data and also perform poorly on new data."

For example, if you use too much sugar, the cake may be too sweet, but if you use too little flour, the cake may be too dense.\n",
