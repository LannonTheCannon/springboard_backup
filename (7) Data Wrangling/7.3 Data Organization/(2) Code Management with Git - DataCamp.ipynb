    "### What is version control?\n",
    "* A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist; this lesson focuses on one called Git, which is used by many of the data science tools covered in our other lessons. Its strengths are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git."

    "* Each of your Git projects has two parts: the files and directories that you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. The combination of these two things is called a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called .git located in the root directory of the repository. Git expects this information to be laid out in a very precise way, so you should never edit or delete anything in .git."
