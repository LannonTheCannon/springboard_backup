    "# SQL for Joining Data\n",
    "Now that you've learned the basics of SQL, it's time to supercharge your queries using joins and relational set theory. In this course, you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self joins, semi joins, anti joins and cross joinsâ€”fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. Never fear set theory again after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries. You will be able to visually grasp these ideas by using Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations."

    "The course is about using SQL to join two or more database tables into a single table, with a focus on INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN. The instructor provides diagrams to help understand the mechanics of different joins. An example is given using the prime_ministers and presidents tables to find countries with both a prime minister and a president using INNER JOIN. The syntax for INNER JOIN in SQL is explained, and practice exercises are provided."

    "In this video, the instructor introduces the USING keyword in SQL and how it can be used in joins. The video starts by recapping the INNER JOIN diagram and SQL code needed to complete it. Then, the video demonstrates how to use the USING clause instead of the ON clause when the key field to join on has the same name in both tables. The example of joining the prime_ministers table to the presidents table to determine countries with both types of leaders is revisited to demonstrate the use of USING. The instructor notes that it doesn't matter the order in which the tables are placed in the join if we select columns from both tables. Finally, the video concludes with a practice exercise on INNER JOINs."

    "### Self-ish joins, just in CASE \n",
    "The article discusses self-joins in SQL where a table is joined with itself, allowing the comparison of values in a field to other values of the same field from within the same table. A self-join example is given using the \"prime_ministers\" table where a new table is created showing countries that are in the same continent matched as pairs. The article highlights the use of the key columns to match the table to itself and the need to avoid listing the country with itself. The \"CASE\" command is introduced as a useful tool for grouping numerical data into categories using simplified if-then-else statements. An example is given using the \"indep_year\" field in the \"states\" table where values are grouped into categories of before 1900, between 1900 and 1930, and after 1930. The article also includes practice exercises and a challenge to test the reader's knowledge of the chapter 1 material."

    "## Outer Joins and Cross Joins\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll come to grips with different kinds of outer joins. You'll learn how to gain further insights into your data through left joins, right joins, and full joins. In addition to outer joins, you'll also work with cross joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 2 of the course, you will learn about OUTER JOINs. There are three types of OUTER JOINs: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN. Unlike INNER JOINs, which only keep the records that are present in both tables, OUTER JOINs keep all the records from one table and combine them with the matching records from the other table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LEFT JOIN operation keeps all the records from the left table and combines them with the matching records from the right table. If there are no matches in the right table, the values are marked as missing. The RIGHT JOIN operation does the opposite: it keeps all the records from the right table and combines them with the matching records from the left table. If there are no matches in the left table, the values are marked as missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN is similar to that of INNER JOIN, with the difference being the keyword used. In LEFT JOIN, the keyword is \"LEFT JOIN,\" and in RIGHT JOIN, the keyword is \"RIGHT JOIN.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also learn about FULL JOIN, which combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. In FULL JOIN, all the records from both tables are kept and combined. If there are no matches in one table, the values are marked as missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To practice OUTER JOINs, you can use the diagrams provided and write SQL queries using the appropriate JOIN keyword."

    "## Set Theory Clauses \n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn more about set theory using Venn diagrams and get an introduction to union, union all, intersect, and except clauses. You'll finish by investigating semi joins and anti joins, which provide a nice introduction to subqueries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of the material focuses on set theory clauses, specifically the operations of UNION and UNION ALL. The video explains how Venn diagrams can be used to represent set operations, where each circle represents a table of data and the shading represents what is included in the result of the set operation from each table. UNION includes every record in both tables but does not double-count those that are in both tables, while UNION ALL includes every record in both tables and does replicate those that are in both tables. The video then provides diagrams and examples of UNION and UNION ALL operations on tables with one field, as well as the monarchs table in the leaders database. The resulting table from the UNION gives all the leaders and their corresponding country. The video concludes by explaining that UNION and UNION ALL clauses stack records on top of each other from one table to the next without doing a lookup step."

    "## Subqueries\n",
    "In this closing chapter, you'll learn how to use nested queries and you'll use what youâ€™ve learned in this course to solve three challenge problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This text is a summary of the last chapter of a course on SQL queries. The chapter is focused on subqueries, also known as nested queries, which are queries embedded inside other queries. The text explains the most common types of subqueries, which are those inside the WHERE and SELECT clauses. The chapter provides examples of using subqueries in both of these contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example shows how to use a subquery inside a WHERE clause to determine the average fertility rate across a group of countries. The chapter then uses this subquery to identify Asian countries with fertility rates below the average. The second example shows how to use a subquery inside a SELECT clause to count the number of countries listed in a table for each continent in another table. The chapter provides the stepwise approach to set up this query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text also emphasizes the importance of giving subqueries an alias, especially when used in a SELECT clause. The chapter concludes with practice exercises to test subquery expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Analogy*** \n",
    "- Think of subqueries like nesting dolls. Just like how nesting dolls have smaller dolls inside a larger doll, subqueries have queries inside other queries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Subqueries are important because they allow you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes it easier to write and understand SQL queries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Using subqueries is like solving a puzzle. You have a big picture that you want to solve, but it can be overwhelming to tackle all at once. So, you break it down into smaller pieces and solve each one separately. Once all the pieces are solved, you can put them back together to see the bigger picture."

    "The text provides a course review of SQL and PostgreSQL, specifically covering the types of joins, set theory clauses, semi-joins and anti-joins, and subqueries. It starts by highlighting the four types of joins, which are INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, and also explains the differences between them. The text then moves on to explain the differences between set theory clauses, including UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT. It also covers semi-joins and anti-joins, explaining how they are useful in filtering tables based on specific conditions. The text then goes on to explain the three types of basic subqueries that are commonly used in SQL, including subqueries in the WHERE, SELECT, and FROM clauses. The text concludes by encouraging the reader to take on the challenge problems to solidify their understanding of SQL and PostgreSQL.\n",

    "* Think of learning SQL and PostgreSQL like learning how to navigate a complex city with different roads and intersections. Just like a city has different types of roads that lead to different destinations, SQL has different types of joins that lead to different results. You need to know which roads to take to reach your destination just like you need to know which join to use to get the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additionally, just like a city has different neighborhoods with different characteristics, tables in a database have different attributes and fields that can be compared and combined through set theory clauses like UNION and INTERSECT.\n",
